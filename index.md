# About
My passion is engineering. I have many hobbies and projects, spanning car modification, circuit design, and game development. I made this site to showcase my work, and to educate and inspire others. It is my dream to entertain and improve the lives of people with the things I create. As an undergraduate studying Computer Engineering at UC San Diego, I seek to further my skills and share my passion.
