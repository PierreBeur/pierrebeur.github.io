One of the key factors for success when it comes to any kind of project is the support of others. Most often this comes in the form of online resources. During the course of a car project, manuals and diagrams found online are often the only way to get necessary information. For more particular or complex situations, including engine swaps, online forums allow you to learn from other individualsâ€™ personal experiences, or even ask questions directly. For example, a car project involving Honda parts would benefit greatly from posts on the [Honda-Tech forums](https://honda-tech.com/forums/).

Many of the products that exist for the purposes of making car projects easier or more affordable could not without an online presence. A perfect example of this is the open-source [rusEFI](https://rusefi.com/) project, which primarily exists online. While the company does sell products, it distributes [schematics](https://github.com/rusefi/hw_microRusEfi) to reproduce them, as well as continuously updated [documentation](https://wiki.rusefi.com/) on their operation, and software updates. They also maintain a [forum](https://rusefi.com/forum/) and a slack channel.

Game development projects have a similar time investment to car projects. Creating a game is difficult enough on its own, without having to deal with creating the core structure, called a game engine. One of the best options currently available is the free and open-source [Godot engine](https://godotengine.org/). Through the combined effort of hundreds of contributors on [GitHub](https://github.com/godotengine), an easy to use, streamlined game engine and excellent [documentation](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/) have been created and made available to use by anyone, for free.
